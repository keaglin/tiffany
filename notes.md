Issues/Needs Work
  - overlay on mobile: it comes up, but we need a way to put it back down
  - descriptions on smaller blocks might be too small
  - Materialize has text color white even when it should be black (according to the docs and visibility)

  - need to adjust text positioning and sizes based on media queries
  - remove black bars from the video
  - make note of all the weird breakpoints so you can add media queries; to ensure a consistent experience
